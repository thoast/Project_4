\section{Conclusion}



Ihe Ising model has in this project been used to study some of the basic physical properties of a two dimensional lattice. A two dimensional model was analyzed both analytically and numerical and the results were compared. The numerical approach gave accurate results within what can be expected for a numerical model. For this system $10^5$ cycles was necessary to reach convergence. The system was then expanded to a $20\times20$ lattice. Here only the numerical approach was possible due to the challenges faced with the partition function in the analytical approach. The system was then sat to two different temperatures and further studies on the steady state and acceptance frequency was made. Here temperature was found to increase the jump frequency, and broaden the range of energy states in the system.
Lastly a phase transition of the system was analyzed and a critical temperature was found. The critical temperature was close to the temperature found by Onsager.

The largest room for improvement found be to increase the amount of points used in the phase transition calculations. This plot, at least visually looked like it had room for improvement with more datapoints. The reason why this was not done in this project was due to limited computational power.
